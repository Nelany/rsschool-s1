Hello! My name is Svetlana, and I'm happy to be here as a beginner front-end developer. The RS School is my first encounter with this profession. Learning here is a bit difficult for me, but I find it very interesting, and I am ready to put in all my efforts to conquer this exciting summit.

I graduated from an art college, worked as a designer for some time, then graduated from medical university and worked as a doctor in several hospitals. Even though I miss my little cute patients, now I want to learn front-end development. My experience may not be the best for a programmer, but sometimes skills from one job can help in another.

All my life, I have had a deep love for beauty. Not just as a pretty picture, but as a complex system. This may sound strange, but for me beauty is both the design behind a work of art, the complex structure of living organisms, and the system underlying human creations. The more interesting, and optimally designed the system, the more beautiful it is for me. This applies to every line and function of the code snippet. I really enjoy it and when I solve a problem or understand a difficult solution, I feel so happy.

From past projects, I can't pinpoint a favorite, since they were all very interesting, new and exciting for me.However, one of the most exciting moments now seems to be the process of creating an algorithm that generates fields for nonograms. It was really cool.

So that's it. Let's build a future where technology makes our lives better and more beautiful! I will be glad to communicate, interesting learning and cooperation! Have a good day!
