## Reflections

1. #### Getting Started with TypeScript

   This module introduced me to the TypeScript language, explained why it was created, and demonstrated how to use it for JavaScript development. I also set up the TypeScript development environment for future exercises.

2. #### Declare Variable Types in TypeScript

   In this module, I learned about the advantages of declaring typed variables in TypeScript. I was also introduced to some available types and shown how to associate them with variables.

3. #### Implement Interfaces in TypeScript

   In this module, I learned how to use interfaces as a way of defining a "code contract" within my code, as well as "contracts" with code outside of the project.

4. #### Develop Typed Functions in TypeScript

   In this module, I learned about the advantages of using types in functions. I also became acquainted with functions that have required, optional, default, and rest parameters. Additionally, I was introduced to defining function types using type aliases or interfaces.

5. #### Declare and Instantiate Classes in TypeScript

   In this module, I learned how to use TypeScript classes to describe the shape of objects, how to enforce class shape using an interface. I was also explained when to use an interface or a class to define the structure of an object.

6. #### Define generics in TypeScript

   In this module, I got acquainted with generics, which are code templates that provide the ability to inform functions, classes, or interfaces about the type to use when they are called.

7. #### Access external libraries from TypeScript

   This instructional module introduced me to TypeScript modules. Additionally, I was encouraged to import an external type library.

8. #### Organize code using TypeScript namespaces

   In this module, I was introduced to organizing TypeScript code using namespaces. The module also provided an overview of the design features when using namespaces and modules.
