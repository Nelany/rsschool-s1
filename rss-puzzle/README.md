# RSS Puzzle ðŸ§©
RSS Puzzle is an interactive mini-game designed to boost English language skills by assembling sentences from scrambled words. Inspired by Lingualeo's Phrase Constructor, it offers six difficulty levels, each containing a varying number of rounds. The game features hint options and versatile word placementâ€”drag-and-drop or clicking to move words between the answer field and back.

Features include auto-fill, sentence accuracy checking, progression to the next sentence, and the ability to disable audio or text hints. All these functions are presented through an intuitive interface. To start the game, players are required to enter their name, which is saved locally for convenience.
