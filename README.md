# Fun Chat
Fun Chat is a WebSocket-based single-page application for real-time messaging. The app features authentication, message editing and deletion, delivery/read statuses, and an engaging user experience. A unique "Butterfly Mode" adds a whimsical touch, allowing users to toggle a peaceful background of flying butterflies by clicking a special button. To restore the chat, simply catch and click the same butterfly. Note: The app server might spin down due to inactivity, causing delays of up to 50 seconds for initial requests.
