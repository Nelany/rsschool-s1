Hangman Game ðŸŽ®
Hangman is a classic word guessing game where players try to guess a secret word one letter at a time. The game includes both a virtual keyboard and physical keyboard support for guessing letters. Players have six attempts to guess the word before the game ends, with each incorrect guess adding a body part to the gallows. The game is over when the word is solved or the gallows are fully constructed.

Features:

Random question-answer pairs are selected at the beginning of the game.
Game UI adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
User can interact with the game using both on-screen and physical keyboards.
Incorrect guesses update a counter and add body parts to the gallows in a logical order.
At the end of the game, a modal displays the result and allows the user to play again.

Technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
-  design (mobile-first approach)
