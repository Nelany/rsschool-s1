# - Async-race
Async Race is a dynamic single-page application for managing a collection of radio-controlled cars and hosting interactive drag races. The app features car customization, animations, and race statistics, offering a seamless experience with responsive design and intuitive controls. Built with pure TypeScript, it includes car CRUD operations, engine management, and detailed race results. Note: The server instance may spin down due to inactivity, causing delays of up to 50 seconds for initial requests.
